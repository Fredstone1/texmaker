abstract = {As every mobile network, LTE (Long Term Evolution) system also needs to be managed. Since LTE is an evolvement of UMTS, the management should also evolve from UMTS. There is a trend to simplify the management by auto-configuration and auto-optimization. However, the complexity of LTE system also place new demands on the Operations and Maintenances of the network. Self-Organizing Networks (SON) is seen as one of the promising area for an operator to save operational expenditures. SON is therefore currently discussed in 3GPP standardisation. This paper provides some background on SON principles, introduces different architectures that are considered and describes some exemplary procedures.},

abstract = {A new air interface designed by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for cellular networks is the Long Term Evolution (LTE) . It represents a major advance, designed to meet the needs for high-speed data and media transport as well as high-capacity voice support for carriers. 3GPP work on the evolution of the 3G mobile system and is aimed to achieve additional substantial leaps in terms of service provisioning and cost reduction.The aim of self-planning is to provide as optimum parameter set as possible for new network setup without manual planning effort.},
